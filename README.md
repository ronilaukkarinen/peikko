# peikko

Peikko is a home server running inside of Roni "rolle" Laukkarinen's wardrobe. Peikko.us is a website front end of that home server. You can see the page live by navigating to [www.peikko.us](https://peikko.us).

No need for documentation, since this is just a backup and meant for me only.

This project actually started years back (I think I first got the server in 2005 or even before that), so some of the code can be messy.

### Background

I'm a Red Hat-guy, so all of my *server* distros have been Red Hat-based. I first had SUSE for a long time in the 2000s, then CentOS in 2013, now Fedora in 2015.
